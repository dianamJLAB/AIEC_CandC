For the first time, the Jefferson Lab [GlueX](http://www.gluex.org/) Central Drift Chamber was autonomously calibrated and controlled using machine learning while recording cosmic ray tracks. A Gaussian Process, implemented using the scikit-learn library, was trained to predict the gain correction factor and to inform a high voltage setting that will stabilize the CDC gain in response to changing environmental conditions. Using ML to perform near real time calibrations significantly reduces the required computing resources typically used in the traditional, post hoc calibration process.
